# Learning Python basics with Zookeeper project

This is my first time using GitHub and my first Python program on project "Zookeeper" from JetBrains Academy.

Zookeeper.py
This program receives an integer from 0-5 and prints an animal status asigned to that number. Program terminates when it receives the word "exit".
